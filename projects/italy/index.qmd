The final project of my COMP/STAT 212 Intermediate Data Science class, this interactive blog post built using Quarto and Shiny analyses archeobotanical data from across Italy as well as modern-day agriculture production data. My partner Grace Bettenburg and I investigated spatial and temporal patterns of agriculture in Italy in order to explore how humans' relationships to plants have changed over time and how these relationships are tied to location.
